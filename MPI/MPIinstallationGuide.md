Steps to install & configure the MPI(For Stand-alone machine),

1. Download **MPICH3.2 stable** from following link, 
     http://www.mpich.org/downloads/

2. **Extract** the tar with command, 
	     **tar -xvf mpich-3.2.tar.gz**
   And, go into the directory /mpich-3.2


3. Then disable the** fortran** with command,
	     **./configure --disable-fortran**


4. Finally, last command,

	  	  sudo apt-get install libmpich-dev
          
	  	  sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev


Then we can start executing our **MPI program on gcc compiler**.
