***Matrix Multiplication Program***

First, you can run the **MatrixMulTime.c** and check how much time it takes to complete the Matrix Multiplication.

Then, you simply run the **MPIMatrixMultiplication.c** and check if the matrix multiplication is working properly along with MPI functions or not. 

Finally, run the **MPIMatrixMulWithTime.c** to run the matrix multiplication using MPI framework and get the time to execute the program.
